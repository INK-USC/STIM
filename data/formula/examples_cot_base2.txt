Question: What is 10101 - 1111 equal to?
Answer: To calculate 10101 - 1111, we need to first calculate 10101 - 1. 10101 - 1 = 10100. Then we need to calculate 10100 - 10. 10100 - 10 = 10010. Then we need to calculate 10010 - 100. 10010 - 100 = 1110. Then we need to calculate 1110 - 1000. 1110 - 1000 = 110. So the answer is 110.
