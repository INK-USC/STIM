Going through each item in the list, we will tally the occurrences of '*' specifically.\n\nNow, let's count:\n- The list has 40 positions, and going through it, we count:\n\nCounting the '*' characters:\n- From the left, we list them:\n  - *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, = 18 asterisks before the first '#'\n  - Then, we see the next set of asterisks, which is:\n  - *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, = 17 asterisks in the second segment before meeting another '#'\n  - Next, we have 2 '#' characters separating the segments.\n  - Moving forward after the second '#', we find:\n  - *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, = 18 asterisks after the last '#' but before the end.\n\nLet's sum them up:\n- First segment: 18\n- Second segment: 17\n- Third segment: 18\n\nAdding these counts together:\n18 + 17 + 18 = 53\n\nSo the answer is 53."
